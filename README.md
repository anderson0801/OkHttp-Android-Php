# OkHttp-Android-Php

HTTP is the way modern applications network. Itâ€™s how we exchange data & media. Doing HTTP efficiently makes your stuff load faster and saves bandwidth.

Using OkHttp is easy. Its request/response API is designed with fluent builders and immutability. It supports both synchronous blocking calls and async calls with callbacks.

##Dependency for Android:##

```compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.4.1'```

GET A URL
```
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

String run(String url) throws IOException {
  Request request = new Request.Builder()
      .url(url)
      .build();

  Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
  return response.body().string();
}
```
POST TO A SERVER
```
public static final MediaType JSON
    = MediaType.parse("application/json; charset=utf-8");

OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

String post(String url, String json) throws IOException {
  RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(JSON, json);
  Request request = new Request.Builder()
      .url(url)
      .post(body)
      .build();
  Response response = client.newCall(request).execute();
  return response.body().string();
}
```
